This script is intended to be included in snmpd to supply the IF-MIB::ifAlias
tree (OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18) with the Linux kernel's interface aliases in
a performant way. To use, include the following line in your snmpd.conf:

pass_persist -p 126 .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18 /usr/local/bin/ifAliasPersist.py
